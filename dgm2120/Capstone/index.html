    <p>The Caribbean is open and ready to welcome you with thousands of exciting and varied activities across about one hundred of ports of call.
    Find your destination and get ready to embark on a fantastic adventure. 
    <br><br>
    Overall, the vast majority of Caribbean destinations are open for business and welcoming thousands of cruise passengers every day. 
    <br><br>
    Of nearly 100 ports in the Caribbean, almost 85 percent are open and fully operational. This number is expected to rise to over 90 percent in coming weeks.
    <br><br>
    For perspective, the Caribbean is an extraordinarily immense region that stretches for over one million square miles. As a result, the vast majority of the islands were not in the paths of the August and September hurricanes and most of the region’s ports incurred minimal or no damage and have been and continue to be in operation.</p>

        <dd>"If I were in your shoes, I'd make final payment without hesitation and make up my mind that I'm going and will have fun no matter what changes may be in store. That's what cruising is all about--being laid back, going with the flow, embracing whatever each day offers, and taking satisfaction from knowing you left a few dollars behind in places where they're needed. Personal satisfaction may end up coming from knowing that you were able to call in an affected port and had the privilege of leaving behind much needed revenue for island locals."

        <dd>"I wanted to share that we were very impressed with the Cruise Director Matt Mitcham and Captain Battinelli especially -- as well as the staff of the (Carnival) Vista. 
        We booked a 6 day cruise and cruised for 9. We are sitting in the airport now waiting on our flight home. Communications were frequent during the storm and everyone was informed of the Captains plan. Announcements were even made in other languages. We were never in rough waters, the service and food was consistently good. The cruise director was the most energetic and charismatic that I have seen in 7 cruises! Although we were praying for residents affected by the storm, we were still able to rest and have fun. I have not danced that much in 11 years!"
